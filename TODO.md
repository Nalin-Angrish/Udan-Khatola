Nalin, Aman and Abhigyan:  
[ ] - Add Kalman Filter  
[ ] - Use Cascading PID  
[x] - Use gyroscope readings to get angle  

Kshitij and Ponnathavan (Research):  
[ ] - PID tuning  
[ ] - Aerodynamics stuff  

Pradhyuman and Sarthak:  
[ ] - Use RF receiver to control  
[ ] - Add throttle control functionality with RF receiver  

Aman and Arjun:  
[x] - maintain 50Hz freq (add suitable delays)  
[x] - Implement yaw control  
[ ] - Use 2 servo motors instead of 1 for ailerons  

Nalin:  
[ ] - Update README  
      - Replace library doc images with text  
      - Complete the description after project completion.

Notes:  
- RF Transmitter will send angle, not rate.  
- Use kalman filter for all 3 axes
- Single loop PID for yaw and Cascading PID for roll and pitch
